# Objects: Nested

Given the following `artistInfo` object:

```javascript
const artistInfo = {
  name: "Talking Heads",
  genre: "New Wave",
  origin: "New York City",
  members: [
    {
      firstName: "David",
      lastName: "Byrne",
      instruments: {
        main: "Vocals",
        secondary: "Guitar",
      },
    },
    {
      firstName: "Chris",
      lastName: "Frantz",
      instruments: {
        main: "Drums",
      },
    },
    {
      firstName: "Tina",
      lastName: "Weymouth",
      instruments: {
        main: "Bass",
      },
    },
    {
      firstName: "Jerry",
      lastName: "Harrison",
      instruments: {
        main: "Keyboards",
        secondary: "Guitar",
      },
    },
  ],
};

console.log(artistInfo.___________);
// => { main: "Vocals", secondary: "Guitar" }
```

Fill in the blank in the code above. What could I write to access the value for
the first member's instruments?

## Correct

members[0].instruments
