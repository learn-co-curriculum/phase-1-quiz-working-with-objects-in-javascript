# Objects: Modifying

I want to create a new object by combining multiple objects into a single
object. Which method should I use?

## Correct

`Object.assign()`

> Correct! The `Object.assign()` method copies
> all[enumerable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/propertyIsEnumerable)properties
> from one or more _source objects_ to a _target object_!

## Incorrect

`Object.keys()`

> Try again!
> 
> The `Object.keys()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable
> property **names** , iterated in the same order that a normal loop would.

## Incorrect

`Object.values()`

> Try again! The `Object.values()` method returns an array of a given object's own
> enumerable property values, in the same order as that provided by
> a[`for...in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)loop.
> (The only difference is that a `for...in`loop enumerates properties in the
> prototype chain as well.)

## Incorrect

I don't know.
