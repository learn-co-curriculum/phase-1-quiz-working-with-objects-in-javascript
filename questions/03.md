# Objects: Modifying

I want to combine multiple objects into a single object. Which method should I
use?

## Correct

Object.assign()

> Correct!
> 
> The&nbsp;**`Object.assign()`**&nbsp;method copies
> all&nbsp;[enumerable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/propertyIsEnumerable)&nbsp;[own
> properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty)&nbsp;from
> one or more&nbsp;_source objects_&nbsp;to a&nbsp;_target object!_

## Incorrect

Object.keys()

> Try again!
> 
> The&nbsp;`Object.keys()`&nbsp;method returns an array of a given object's own
> enumerable property&nbsp; **names** , iterated in the same order that a normal
> loop would.

## Incorrect

Object.values()

> Try again!
> 
> The&nbsp;`Object.values()`&nbsp;method returns an array of a given object's own
> enumerable property values, in the same order as that provided by
> a&nbsp;[`for...in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)&nbsp;loop.
> (The only difference is that a&nbsp;`for...in`&nbsp;loop enumerates properties
> in the prototype chain as well.)

## Incorrect

I don't know.
