# Objects: Iterating

```javascript
const address = {
  name: "P. Sherman",
  street2: "42 Wallaby Way",
  city: "Sydney",
  state: "New South Whales",
  country: "AUS",
};
```

## Correct

`for...in`

> Correct! The `for...in` statement iterates over all[enumerable
> properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties)of
> an object that are keyed by strings (ignoring ones keyed
> by[Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)s),
> including inherited enumerable properties.

## Incorrect

`for...of`

> Try again! The `for...of` statement iterates over the value of an iterable
> objects, like arrays.

## Incorrect
