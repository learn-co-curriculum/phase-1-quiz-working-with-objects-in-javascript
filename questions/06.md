# Objects: Nested

I want to access the value for the band's origin in the following object. How
would I access that?

```
const artistInfo = { name: 'Talking Heads', genre: 'New Wave', origin: 'New York City', members: [{ firstName: 'David', lastName: 'Byrne', instruments: { main: 'Vocals', secondary: 'Guitar' } }, { firstName: 'Chris', lastName: 'Frantz', instruments: { main: 'Drums' } }, { firstName: 'Tina', lastName: 'Weymouth', instruments: { main: 'Bass' } }, { firstName: 'Jerry', lastName: 'Harrison', instruments: { main: 'Keyboards', secondary: 'Guitar' } }]}
```

## Correct

artistInfo.origin

> Correct!&nbsp;
> 
> By using dot notation, we are able to access the value of the origin key!

## Incorrect

artistInfo[origin]

> Try again!
> 
> Remember when using bracket notation, we have to call the property accessor as a
> string!

## Incorrect

artistInfo['New York City']

> Try again!
> 
> In order to get the value 'New York City', we need to grab it using it's key (or
> property accessor!)
