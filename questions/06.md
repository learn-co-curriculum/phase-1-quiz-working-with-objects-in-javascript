# Objects: Nested

Given the following object:

```javascript
const artistInfo = {
  name: "Talking Heads",
  genre: "New Wave",
  origin: "New York City",
  members: [
    {
      firstName: "David",
      lastName: "Byrne",
      instruments: { main: "Vocals", secondary: "Guitar" },
    },
    { firstName: "Chris", lastName: "Frantz", instruments: { main: "Drums" } },
    { firstName: "Tina", lastName: "Weymouth", instruments: { main: "Bass" } },
    {
      firstName: "Jerry",
      lastName: "Harrison",
      instruments: { main: "Keyboards", secondary: "Guitar" },
    },
  ],
};
```

What code would I need to write to access the band's origin?

## Correct

```javascript
artistInfo.origin;
```

> Correct! By using dot notation, we are able to access the value of the origin
> key!

## Incorrect

```javascript
artistInfo[origin];
```

> Try again! Remember when using bracket notation, we have to call the property
> accessor as a string!

## Incorrect

```javascript
artistInfo["New York City"];
```

> Try again! In order to get the value 'New York City', we need to use its key (or
> property accessor).

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
