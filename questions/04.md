# Objects: Iterating

I have the following object, and I want to log each of the values. What is the
best way to do this?

```
const address = { name: 'P. Sherman', street2: '42 Wallaby Way', city: 'Sydney', state: 'New South Whales', country: 'AUS'};
```

## Correct

`for (const key in address) { console.log(address[key]) }`

> Correct!
> 
> By using the bracket operator, we are successfully able to access the objects
> values.&nbsp;

## Incorrect

`for (const key in address) { console.log(address.key) }`

> Try again!
> 
> The&nbsp;`for...in`&nbsp;statement iterates over the five properties
> in&nbsp;`address`, successively passing in the object's keys. However, inside
> the statement body we're trying to access&nbsp;`address.key`. If you recall from
> the lesson on objects, variables don't work with the dot operator because it
> treats the variable name as a literal key â€”&nbsp;that
> is,&nbsp;`address.key`&nbsp;is trying to access the property
> on&nbsp;`address`&nbsp;with a key of&nbsp;`key`. Since there is
> no&nbsp;`key`&nbsp;property in&nbsp;`address`, it returns&nbsp;`undefined`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
