# Objects: Iterating

I have the following object, and I want to log each of the values. What is the
best way to do this?

```javascript
const address = {
  name: "P. Sherman",
  street2: "42 Wallaby Way",
  city: "Sydney",
  state: "New South Whales",
  country: "AUS",
};
```

## Correct

```javascript
for (const key in address) {
  console.log(address[key]);
}
```

> Correct!
> 
> By using the bracket operator, we are successfully able to access the objects
> values.

## Incorrect

```javascript
for (const key in address) {
  console.log(address.key);
}
```

> Try again!
> 
> The `for...in` statement iterates over the five properties in `address`,
> successively passing in the object's keys. However, inside the statement body
> we're trying to access `address.key`. If you recall from the lesson on objects,

> as a literal key â€” that is, `address.key` is trying to access the property on
> `address` with a key of `key`. Since there is no `key`property in `address`, it
> returns `undefined`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
